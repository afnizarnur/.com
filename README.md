## Background

When I was in vocational high school back in 2013, I created a portfolio website to showcase my design work. I remember using static HTML and CSS, along with the Bootstrap framework, and hosting it on a shared hosting platform. Honestly, it was a lot of fun! Building that website opened up numerous work opportunities for me. Fast forward to now, I have officially graduated from university and entered the professional world, where having a portfolio is always crucial. That's why I've decided to start from scratch and create a new portfolio with a deeper meaning. Through designing the site, I aim to gain knowledge about design systems in terms of both design and user interface aspects. Similarly, by developing the site, I want to learn about design systems from a developer's perspective. So, without further ado, here is my portfolio site. I'm sharing this repository primarily for myself, and I've chosen to host my code on GitHub for convenience and peace of mind. Feel free to explore the contents of the code.
