## Background

When I was in vocational high school back in 2013, I created a portfolio website to showcase my design work. I remember using static HTML and CSS, along with the Bootstrap framework, and hosting it on a shared hosting platform. Honestly, it was a lot of fun! Building that website opened up numerous work opportunities for me. Through designing the site, I aim to gain knowledge about design systems in terms of both design and user interface aspects. Similarly, by developing the site, I want to learn about design systems from a developer's perspective. I'm sharing this repository primarily for myself, and I've chosen to host my code on GitHub for convenience and peace of mind. Feel free to explore the contents of the code.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

    git clone https://github.com/afnizarnur/afnizarnur.com.git
