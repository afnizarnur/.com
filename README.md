## Background

When I in vocational high-school(it was 2013), I ever built a portfolio site to promote my work on design area. I remember it was built with static HTML and CSS, with Bootstrap framework, hosted in shared hosting. To be honest it was so fun! I got so many work opportunities after building that one. Long story short, because now I'm officially graduated from University, in a professional career, a portfolio is always an important thing. So, I want to build the portfolio again from scratch with something meaningful on it. By designing the site, I want to learn about design system on the design or user interface aspect. By developing the site, I want to learn about design system by developer aspect. So here it is! My portfolio site. I share this repository is basically for me, I host my code in GitHub for ease of work and peace of mind. You can explore the things inside the code.
