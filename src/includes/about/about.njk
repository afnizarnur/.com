        <p class="body-large">I am passionate about all areas of design and I believe that design provides a better approach to solving human problems. I deeply value human-centered design that is meaningful and impactful.</p>
        <p>As a designer with an engineering background, I am skilled in thinking in code and system architecture, while also being capable of abstract and high-level thinking. Throughout my journey, I have come to understand that design and engineering complement each other to create extraordinary results.</p>
        <p>In my work, I primarily engage in the end-to-end workflow of product development. This involves conducting user research to gain a better understanding of users and their business needs, experimenting through prototyping, and performing user testing to validate and enhance the design. 
        </p>
        <p>Outside of my design work, you can find me doing photography, working on side projects, reading books, watching football, or playing video games.</p>
