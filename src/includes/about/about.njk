				I am passionate about all areas of design and I believe that
				design provides a better approach to solving human problems. I
				deeply value human-centered design that is meaningful and
				impactful.

				My name is Afnizar Nur Ghifari, but people usually call me
				Afnizar. Currently, I reside in Serang, Indonesia. My primary
				focus at the moment lies at the intersection of design, code,
				and systems. I also have a deep interest in icon design and
				building things, such as
				<a

					>Figma plugins</a
				>
				or <a href="https://natatoko.com/">startups</a>. My day-to-day
				activities mostly involve from the beginning to the end of the
				product development process. Besides design, I sometimes
				tinkering about web development.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am a graduate of Telkom University in Bandung, with a degree
				in informatics engineering. As a designer with an engineering
				background, I feel comfortable working with systems and code.
				That’s a why I love working on design systems. Through my
				journey until now, I've come to understand that design and
				engineering complement each other in building better products.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I'm not in front of a screen, I enjoy reading books,
				watching football, or playing video games. I'm especially
				interested to learn more about video games because, from my
				perspective, they are fascinating type of craft. I'm
				also a hobbyist street photographer, and I often share my photos
				on my
				<a href="https://www.instagram.com/afnizar_nur/">Instagram</a>.
				Well, It's a lot of interests!
			</p>
			<p>
				I also enjoy listening to dangdut, keroncong, and campursari
				(It’s traditional music genre from Indonesia). I started
				appreciating these type of music during my college years,
				especially after listening
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didi_Kempot"
					>Didi Kempot</a
				>. As a native Javanese, my cultural background is one of the
				reasons I’m fond of this genre, and I believe that young people
				today should also listen to it because it's part of our culture.
				I also often curate playlists on
				<a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/afnizarnur">Spotify</a>.

				That's a brief introduction about me. Feel free to reach out if
				you're interested in discussing anything.
