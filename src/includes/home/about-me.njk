					<strong>Observe, reflect, make–we called it the loop</strong>. The design process is never a one-way street. It's something that constantly evolves, adapting to the challenges we face.</p>

					I’m passionate about all areas of design and I believe in design as a better approach to solving human problem. My interests in design include interaction design, accessibility, and technological design. In between my works, I do front-end development. I also believe with coding, designer can create more impactful experiences by embracing the technicalities that make it happen. I enjoy writing code, and I particularly enjoy writing HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React.
