                    I've always thought of design as a process of getting from
                    point A to point B. But, as I looked back, I realized it
                    wasn't always like that. This is what I call the lopp:
                    observe, reflect, and make. It never takes a single path; it
                    is always changing and adapting to the problems we confront.
                    This isn't a manifesto for design, but it's how I'd like to
                    introduce myself to you.

                    I'd like to create something for anyone interested in
                    learning how to design or code. My goal is to help others
                    reach their goals and contribute to the design community,
                    for all the brilliant designers I've met and those I
                    haven't.
