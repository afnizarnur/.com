Portfolio is an important thing for designer. It helps communicate how designer work and the output of the work. Recruiter is always referred to the portfolio of designer if a team want to work with the designer or not. For me personally, portfolio is a place in the corner of the internet that you can do anything you want. Experimenting things or just showcase your work. It’s totally awesome to see someone sharing their experience and process of creating things.

It’s a bit rare for Indonesian designer has a standalone portfolio site, but when I see it one, I really love their initiative. Because creating portfolio are about investing a lot of things(time and energy). That’s why, I am creating this list so everyone can give them some appreciation or use it for reference!
