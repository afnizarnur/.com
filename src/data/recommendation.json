When it comes to UI design, he's got some seriously solid skills. Plus, he's an awesome teacher when it comes to UI stuff. He explains things in a way that totally makes sense and isn't afraid to give his own opinions. Honestly, a lot of my work is inspired by the design fundamentals and perspectives he has taught, such as achieving pixel-perfect designs, maintaining neat organization in design delivery, and naming pages in design files. His work, Page Automator, has always been my go-to tool when preparing a new file in Figma."
