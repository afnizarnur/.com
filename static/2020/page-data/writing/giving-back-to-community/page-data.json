The teacher gives the task to tell in front of the class our hobbies. I told to everyone in front of the class, that my hobby is designing in Photoshop for 8 hours every week because I heard it took 1000 hours for someone to master something. At that time, I was thrilled to design in Photoshop because of the strong desire to participate and win in a competition. Although Photoshop always not responding after 2 hours ðŸ˜…. Understandably, the laptop at that time was only a laptop with 2GB RAM, with a Core 2 Duo processor, I borrow from my Dad when I was in 7th grade. Thanks, Dad! Even though the laptop eventually became my personal laptop until I graduated from vocational highÂ school.</p>\n<p>Back in English class, I remember very well when the teacher commented on what I said. HeÂ said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Practicing is not enough. Share your knowledge, no need to master it to share it, knowledge will not be used up when someone receives that knowledge until the end of yourÂ life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From his comment, I was intrigued and started to take many opportunities to share by becoming a scout instructor (yes, I am a scout!), leading a computer organization, speaking in front of many people, and being a workshop facilitator. This is a photo of me sharing about the process of UI Design in the industry, the event located in Tegal, CentralÂ Java.</p>\n<p>\n  <figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"margin: 0\">\n  \n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/70156946ab567fee58e307515cafc4d3/c58a3/afnizar-tegal-invofest.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 1500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Workshop at Tegal, Jawa Tengah\"\n        title=\"Workshop at Tegal, Jawa Tengah\"\n        src=\"/static/70156946ab567fee58e307515cafc4d3/c58a3/afnizar-tegal-invofest.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/70156946ab567fee58e307515cafc4d3/4ecad/afnizar-tegal-invofest.jpg 384w,\n/static/70156946ab567fee58e307515cafc4d3/212bf/afnizar-tegal-invofest.jpg 768w,\n/static/70156946ab567fee58e307515cafc4d3/c58a3/afnizar-tegal-invofest.jpg 1500w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n  <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Workshop at Tegal, Jawa Tengah</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n      </p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"starting-to-write-more\"><a href=\"#starting-to-write-more\" aria-label=\"starting to write more permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Starting to writeÂ more</h2>\n<p>But there is one thing that has never been consistent until now, writing! 2 years ago I once set up a blog and have written one post, even though itâ€™s only â€˜Hello Worldâ€™. Not only design that needs to be consistent, consistent in writing isÂ difficult.</p>\n<p>With this new zone in writing, I hope I can be more consistent in writing because, by writing, I believe I can share more of my knowledge and expertise so that it help=s more people to dare to start or who have started to get involved in the designÂ world. <strong>Yes, itâ€™s time to give back to theÂ community</strong>.</p>\n<p>Thank you if you read this until the end. By the way, this website is my second version of the website, which contains a portfolio of work, and indeed I deliberately design and develop it as a place to document work and share knowledge.
